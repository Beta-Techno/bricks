* WARNING: Proxmox Terraform Provider Caveats

** Insecure SSL Verification
- The current Terraform provider configuration for Proxmox uses `insecure = true`.
- This disables SSL certificate verification for the Proxmox API endpoint.
- This is NOT recommended for production environments, as it exposes you to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
- For production, always use a trusted SSL certificate and set `insecure = false`.
- See the provider block in `first-node/main.tf` for details.

** Storage Module Temporarily Removed
- The Proxmox storage module has been removed from the Terraform configuration.
- Reason: The `bpg/proxmox` provider does not yet support storage pool or volume management.
- Once support is added, the storage module can be reintroduced for full declarative storage management.
- Track provider updates at: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs

** Action Items
- Review provider configuration before deploying to production.
- Monitor the bpg/proxmox provider for storage support updates.
