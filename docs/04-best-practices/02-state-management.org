* State Management Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for managing Terraform state in the Bricks infrastructure.

* State Storage

- Use remote state storage (e.g., S3, GCS, Azure Storage)
- Enable state locking
- Use state encryption
- Use different state files for different environments
- Use different state files for different components

* State Organization

- Use workspaces for different environments
- Use different state files for different components
- Use different state files for different regions
- Use different state files for different projects
- Use different state files for different teams

* State Access

- Use IAM roles for state access
- Use different IAM roles for different environments
- Use different IAM roles for different components
- Use different IAM roles for different teams
- Use different IAM roles for different purposes

* State Backup

- Backup state files regularly
- Use versioning for state files
- Use different backup locations for different environments
- Use different backup locations for different components
- Use different backup locations for different teams

* State Security

- Use encryption for state files
- Use different encryption keys for different environments
- Use different encryption keys for different components
- Use different encryption keys for different teams
- Use different encryption keys for different purposes

* State Monitoring

- Monitor state file changes
