#+TITLE: Bricks: Infrastructure Modules
#+AUTHOR: Your Name
#+DATE: 2024

* Overview

Bricks is a collection of reusable infrastructure modules ("bricks") for building and managing Proxmox infrastructure. Each brick is a self-contained component that can be composed to create robust, reproducible, and automated infrastructure.

* Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

** Architecture (01-architecture/)
- Overview of the system architecture
- Module architecture and design
- Environment architecture and design

** Guides (02-guides/)
- Getting started guide
- First node setup guide
- First VM setup guide

** Reference (03-reference/)
- Module reference documentation
- Environment reference documentation

** Best Practices (04-best-practices/)
- Security best practices
- State management best practices
- Versioning best practices

* Core Modules

** Host Module
The host module manages the initial configuration of a Proxmox host, including user management, security settings, and basic network configuration.

** Network Module
The network module manages network configuration for Proxmox hosts, including Linux bridges and VLANs.

** Storage Module
The storage module manages storage configuration for Proxmox hosts, including storage pools and volumes.

** Compute Module
The compute module manages virtual machines and their resources in Proxmox, including VM creation, resource allocation, and template management.

* Environments

** First Node Environment
The first-node environment is used for the initial setup of a Proxmox host, including network configuration, storage setup, and security hardening.

** First VM Environment
The first-vm environment is used for managing virtual machines in Proxmox, including VM creation, resource allocation, and template management.
